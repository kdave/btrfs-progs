Data and metadata are checksummed by default. The checksum is calculated before
writing and verified after reading the blocks from devices. The whole metadata
block has an inline checksum stored in the b-tree node header. Each data block
has a detached checksum stored in the checksum tree.

There are several checksum algorithms supported. The default and backward
compatible algorithm is *crc32c*. Since kernel 5.5 there are three more with different
characteristics and trade-offs regarding speed and strength. The following list
may help you to decide which one to select.

CRC32C (32 bits digest)
        Default, best backward compatibility. Very fast, modern CPUs have
        instruction-level support, not collision-resistant but still good error
        detection capabilities.

XXHASH (64 bits digest)
        Can be used as CRC32C successor. Very fast, optimized for modern CPUs utilizing
        instruction pipelining, good collision resistance and error detection.

SHA256 (256 bits digest)
        Cryptographic-strength hash. Relatively slow but with possible CPU
        instruction acceleration or specialized hardware cards. FIPS certified and
        in wide use.

BLAKE2b (256 bits digest)
        Cryptographic-strength hash. Relatively fast, with possible CPU acceleration
        using SIMD extensions. Not standardized but based on BLAKE which was a SHA3
        finalist, in wide use. The algorithm used is BLAKE2b-256 that's optimized for
        64-bit platforms.

The *digest size* affects overall size of data block checksums stored in the
filesystem.  The metadata blocks have a fixed area up to 256 bits (32 bytes), so
there's no increase. Each data block has a separate checksum stored, with
additional overhead of the b-tree leaves.

Approximate relative performance of the algorithms, measured against CRC32C
using implementations on a 11th gen 3.6GHz intel CPU:

Many kernels are configured with SHA256 as built-in and not as a module.
The accelerated versions are however provided by the modules and must be loaded
explicitly (:command:`modprobe sha256`) before mounting the filesystem to make use of
them. You can check in :file:`/sys/fs/btrfs/FSID/checksum` which one is used. If you
see *sha256-generic*, then you may want to unmount and mount the filesystem
again. Changing that on a mounted filesystem is not possible.
Check the file :file:`/proc/crypto`, when the implementation is built-in, you'd find:

.. code-block:: none

        name         : sha256
        driver       : sha256-generic
        module       : kernel
        priority     : 100
        ...

While accelerated implementation is e.g.:

.. code-block:: none

        name         : sha256
        driver       : sha256-avx2
        module       : sha256_ssse3
        priority     : 170
        ...
