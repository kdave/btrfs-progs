btrfs(8)
========

SYNOPSIS
--------

**btrfs** <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **btrfs** utility is a toolbox for managing btrfs filesystems.  There are
command groups to work with subvolumes, devices, for whole filesystem or other
specific actions. See section *COMMANDS*.

There are also standalone tools for some tasks like **btrfs-convert** or
**btrfstune** that were separate historically and/or haven't been merged to the
main utility. See section *STANDALONE TOOLS* for more details.

For other topics (mount options, etc) please refer to the separate manual
page :doc:`btrfs(5)<btrfs-man5>`.

COMMAND SYNTAX
--------------

Any command name can be shortened so long as the shortened form is unambiguous,
however, it is recommended to use full command names in scripts.  All command
groups have their manual page named **btrfs-<group>**.

For example: it is possible to run **btrfs sub snaps** instead of
**btrfs subvolume snapshot**.
But **btrfs file s** is not allowed, because **file s** may be interpreted
both as **filesystem show** and as **filesystem sync**.

If the command name is ambiguous, the list of conflicting options is
printed.

*Sizes*, both upon input and output,
can be expressed in either SI or IEC-I units
(see :doc:`numfmt(1)<numfmt>`) with the suffix `B` appended.
All numbers will be formatted
according to the rules of the `C` locale
(ignoring the shell locale, see :doc:`locale(7)<locale-man7>`).

For an overview of a given command use **btrfs command --help**
or **btrfs [command...] --help --full** to print all available options.

	See :doc:`btrfs-rescue(8)<btrfs-rescue>` for details.

restore
	Try to restore files from a damaged btrfs filesystem.
	See :doc:`btrfs-restore(8)<btrfs-restore>` for details.

STANDALONE TOOLS
----------------

New functionality could be provided using a standalone tool. If the functionality
proves to be useful, then the standalone tool is declared obsolete and its
functionality is copied to the main tool. Obsolete tools are removed after a
long (years) depreciation period.

Tools that are still in active use without an equivalent in **btrfs**:

btrfs-convert
        in-place conversion from ext2/3/4 filesystems to btrfs
btrfstune
        tweak some filesystem properties on a unmounted filesystem
btrfs-select-super
        rescue tool to overwrite primary superblock from a spare copy
btrfs-find-root
        rescue helper to find tree roots in a filesystem

Deprecated and obsolete tools:

btrfs-debug-tree
        moved to **btrfs inspect-internal dump-tree**. Removed from
        source distribution.
btrfs-show-super
        moved to **btrfs inspect-internal dump-super**, standalone
        removed.
btrfs-zero-log
        moved to **btrfs rescue zero-log**, standalone removed.

For space-constrained environments, it's possible to build a single binary with
functionality of several standalone tools. This is following the concept of
busybox where the file name selects the functionality. This works for symlinks
or hardlinks. The full list can be obtained by **btrfs help --box**.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

**btrfs** returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero is returned in
case of failure.

AVAILABILITY
------------

**btrfs** is part of btrfs-progs.  Please refer to the documentation at
https://btrfs.readthedocs.io or wiki http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org for further
information.
