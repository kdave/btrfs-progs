NAME
----
btrfs-receive - receive subvolumes from send stream

SYNOPSIS
--------
*btrfs receive* [options] <path>

or

*btrfs receive* --dump [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Receive a stream of changes and replicate one or more subvolumes that were
previously generated by *btrfs send*. The received subvolumes are stored to
'path', unless '--dump' option is given.

If '--dump' option is specified, *btrfs receive* will only do the validation of
the stream, and print the stream metadata, one operation per line.

*btrfs receive* will fail int the following cases:

1. receiving subvolume already exists

2. previously received subvolume has been changed after it was received

3. default subvolume has changed or you didn't mount the filesystem at the toplevel subvolume

A subvolume is made read-only after the receiving process finishes succesfully.

`Options`

-v::
increase verbosity about performed actions, print details about each operation

-f <FILE>::
read the stream from <FILE> instead of stdin,

-C|--chroot::
confine the process to 'path' using `chroot`(1)

-e::
terminate after receiving an 'end cmd' marker in the stream.
+
Without this option the receiver side terminates only in case
of an error on end of file.

-E|--max-errors <NERR>::
terminate as soon as NERR errors occur while stream processing commands from
the stream
+
Default value is 1. A value of 0 means no limit.

-m <ROOTMOUNT>::
the root mount point of the destination filesystem
+
By default the mountpoint is searched in '/proc/self/mounts'.
If '/proc' is not accessible, eg. in a chroot environment, use this option to
tell us where this filesystem is mounted.

--dump::
dump the stream metadata, one line per operation
+
Does not require the 'path' parameter. The filesystem chanded.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*btrfs receive* returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero is
returned in case of failure.

AVAILABILITY
------------
*btrfs* is part of btrfs-progs.
