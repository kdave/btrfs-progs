# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------
