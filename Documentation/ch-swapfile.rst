A swapfile is file-backed memory that the system uses to temporarily offload
the RAM.  It is supported since kernel 5.0. Use ``swapon(8)`` to activate the
swapfile. There are some limitations of the implementation in BTRFS and Linux
swap subsystem:

* filesystem - must be only single device
* filesystem - must have only *single* data profile
* swapfile - the containing subvolume cannot be snapshotted
* swapfile - must be preallocated (i.e. no holes)
* swapfile - must be NODATACOW (i.e. also NODATASUM, no compression)

The limitations come namely from the COW-based design and mapping layer of
blocks that allows the advanced features like relocation and multi-device
filesystems. However, the swap subsystem expects simpler mapping and no
background changes of the file block location once they've been assigned to
swap.

With active swapfiles, the following whole-filesystem operations will skip
swapfile extents or may fail:

* balance - block groups with swapfile extents are skipped and reported, the
  rest will be processed normally
* resize grow - unaffected
* resize shrink - works as long as the extents are outside of the shrunk range
* device add - a new device does not interfere with existing swapfile and this
  operation will work, though no new swapfile can be activated afterwards
* device delete - if the device has been added as above, it can be also deleted
* device replace - ditto

When there are no active swapfiles and a whole-filesystem exclusive operation
is running (e.g. balance, device delete, shrink), the swapfiles cannot be
temporarily activated. The operation must finish first.

To create and activate a swapfile run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

        # truncate -s 0 swapfile
        # chattr +C swapfile
        # fallocate -l 2G swapfile
        # chmod 0600 swapfile
        # mkswap swapfile
        # swapon swapfile

Since version 6.1 it's possible to create the swapfile in a single command
(except the activation):

.. code-block:: bash

        # btrfs filesystem mkswapfile swapfile --size 2G
        # swapon swapfile

Please note that the UUID returned by the *mkswap* utility identifies the swap
"filesystem" and because it's stored in a file, it's not generally visible and
usable as an identifier unlike if it was on a block device.

The file will appear in */proc/swaps*:

.. code-block:: none

        # cat /proc/swaps
        Filename          Type          Size           Used      Priority
        /path/swapfile    file          2097152        0         -2

The swapfile can be created as one-time operation or, once properly created,
activated on each boot by the **swapon -a** command (usually started by the
service manager). Add the following entry to */etc/fstab*, assuming the
filesystem that provides the */path* has been already mounted at this point.
Additional mount options relevant for the swapfile can be set too (like
priority, not the BTRFS mount options).

.. code-block:: none

        /path/swapfile        none        swap        defaults      0 0

Hibernation
-----------

A swapfile can be used for hibernation but it's not straightforward. Before
hibernation a resume offset must be written to file */sys/power/resume_offset*
or the kernel command line parameter *resume_offset* must be set.

The value is the physical offset on the device. Note that **this is not the same
value that** ``filefrag`` **prints as physical offset!**

Btrfs filesystem uses mapping between logical and physical addresses but here
the physical can still map to one or more device-specific physical block
addresses. It's the device-specific physical offset that is suitable as resume
offset.

Since version 6.1 there's a command ``btrfs inspect-internal map-swapfile`` that will
print the device physical offset and the adjusted value for */sys/power/resume_offset*.
Note that the value is divided by page size, i.e. it's not the offset itself.

.. code-block:: bash

        # btrfs filesystem mkswapfile swapfile
        # btrfs inspect-internal map-swapfile swapfile
        Physical start: 811511726080
        Resume offset:     198122980

For scripting and convenience the option *-r* will print just the offset:

.. code-block:: bash

        # btrfs inspect-internal map-swapfile -r swapfile
        198122980

The command *map-swapfile* also verifies all the requirements, i.e. no holes,
single device, etc.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If the swapfile activation fails please verify that you followed all the steps
above or check the system log (e.g. ``dmesg`` or ``journalctl``) for more
information.

Notably, the *swapon* utility exits with a message that does not say what
failed:

.. code-block:: none

        # swapon /path/swapfile
	swapon: /path/swapfile: swapon failed: Invalid argument

The specific reason is likely to be printed to the system log by the btrfs
module:

.. code-block:: none

	# journalctl -t kernel | grep swapfile
	kernel: BTRFS warning (device sda): swapfile must have single data profile
