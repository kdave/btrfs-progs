btrfs-receive(8)
================

SYNOPSIS
--------

**btrfs receive** [options] <path>

or

**btrfs receive** --dump [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Receive a stream of changes and replicate one or more subvolumes that were
previously generated by **btrfs send**. The received subvolumes are stored to
*path*, unless *--dump* option is given.

If *--dump* option is specified, **btrfs receive** will only do the validation of
the stream, and print the stream metadata, one operation per line.

**btrfs receive** will fail in the following cases:

1. receiving subvolume already exists

2. previously received subvolume has been changed after it was received

3. default subvolume has changed or you didn't mount the filesystem at the toplevel subvolume

A subvolume is made read-only after the receiving process finishes successfully (see BUGS below).

``Options``

-f <FILE>
        read the stream from *FILE* instead of stdin,

-C|--chroot
        confine the process to *path* using ``chroot(1)``

-e
        terminate after receiving an *end cmd* marker in the stream.

        Without this option the receiver side terminates only in case
        of an error on end of file.

-E|--max-errors <NERR>
        terminate as soon as NERR errors occur while stream processing commands from
        the stream

        Default value is 1. A value of 0 means no limit.

-m <ROOTMOUNT>
        the root mount point of the destination filesystem

        By default the mountpoint is searched in */proc/self/mounts*.
        If */proc* is not accessible, eg. in a chroot environment, use this option to
        tell us where this filesystem is mounted.

--force-decompress
        if the stream contains compressed data (see *--compressed-data* in
        :doc:`btrfs-send(8)<btrfs-send>`), always decompress it instead of writing it with
        encoded I/O

--dump
        dump the stream metadata, one line per operation

        Does not require the *path* parameter. The filesystem remains unchanged.

-q|--quiet
        (deprecated) alias for global *-q* option

-v
        (deprecated) alias for global *-v* option

``Global options``

-v|--verbose
        increase verbosity about performed actions, print details about each operation

-q|--quiet
        suppress all messages except errors

BUGS
----

**btrfs receive** sets the subvolume read-only after it completes
successfully.  However, while the receive is in progress, users who have
write access to files or directories in the receiving *path* can add,
remove, or modify files, in which case the resulting read-only subvolume
will not be an exact copy of the sent subvolume.

If the intention is to create an exact copy, the receiving *path*
should be protected from access by users until the receive operation
has completed and the subvolume is set to read-only.

Additionally, receive does not currently do a very good job of validating
that an incremental send stream actually makes sense, and it is thus
possible for a specially crafted send stream to create a subvolume with
reflinks to arbitrary files in the same filesystem.  Because of this,
users are advised to not use *btrfs receive* on send streams from
untrusted sources, and to protect trusted streams when sending them
across untrusted networks.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

**btrfs receive** returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero is
returned in case of failure.
