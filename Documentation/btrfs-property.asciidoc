NAME
----
btrfs-property - get/set/list properties for given filesystem object

SYNOPSIS
--------
*btrfs property* <subcommand> <args>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*btrfs property* is used to get/set/list property for given filesystem object.
The object can be an inode (file or directory), subvolume or the whole
filesystem.  See the description of *get* subcommand for more information about
both btrfs object and property.

*btrfs property* provides an unified and user-friendly method to tune different
btrfs properties instead of using the traditional method like `chattr`(1) or
`lsattr`(1).

SUBCOMMAND
----------
*get* [-t <type>] <object> [<name>]::
get property from a btrfs <object> of given <type>
+
A btrfs object, which is set by <object>, can be a btrfs filesystem
itself, a btrfs subvolume, an inode (file or directory) inside btrfs,
or a device on which a btrfs exists.
+
The option '-t' can be used to explicitly
specify what type of object you meant. This is only needed when a
property could be set for more then one object type.
+
Possible types are 's[ubvol]', 'f[ilesystem]', 'i[node]' and 'd[evice]', where
the first lettes is a shortcut.
+
Set the name of property by 'name'. If no 'name' is specified,
all properties for the given object are printed. 'name' is one of
the following:

ro::::
read-only flag of subvolume: true or false
label::::
label of device
compression::::
compression algorithm set for an inode, possible values: 'lzo', 'zlib', 'zstd'.
To disable compression use "" (empty string), 'no' or 'none'.

*list* [-t <type>] <object>::
Lists available properties with their descriptions for the given object.
+
See the description of *get* subcommand for the meaning of each option.

*set* [-t <type>] <object> <name> <value>::
Sets a property on a btrfs object.
+
See the description of *get* subcommand for the meaning of each option.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*btrfs property* returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero is
returned in case of failure.

AVAILABILITY
------------
*btrfs* is part of btrfs-progs.
