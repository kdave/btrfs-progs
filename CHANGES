  are no technical obstacles preventing that, so it got enabled with a warning
  about potential dangers when the device will not do the duplicated copies. See
  mkfs.btrfs section DUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE.

    * support balance filters added/enhanced in linux 4.4
      * usage=min..max -- enhanced to take range

      * limit=min..max -- enhanced to take range
  Note: due to backward compatibility, the range maximum for 'usage' is not
  inclusive as for the others, to keep the same behaviour as usage=N .

    * manual pages enhanced (btrfs, mkfs, mount, filesystem, balance)
    * error messages updates, rewordings -- some fstests may break due to that

      this leads to mkfs failure for example due to "no free blocks
