btrfs-progs-4.4 (2016-01-18)
  User visible changes:
    * mkfs.btrfs --data dup

  People asked about duplicating data on a single device for a long time. There
  are no technical obstacles preventing that, so it got enabled with a warning
  about potential dangers when the device will not do the duplicated copies. See
  mkfs.btrfs section DUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE.

    * support balance filters added/enhanced in linux 4.4
      * usage=min..max -- enhanced to take range
      * stripes=min..max -- new, filter by stripes for raid0/10/5/6
      * limit=min..max -- enhanced to take range
  Note: due to backward compatibility, the range maximum for 'usage' is not
  inclusive as for the others, to keep the same behaviour as usage=N .

    * manual pages enhanced (btrfs, mkfs, mount, filesystem, balance)
    * error messages updates, rewordings -- some fstests may break due to that
    * added support for free-space-tree implementation of space cache -- this
      requires kernel 4.5 and is not recommended for non-developers yet
    * btrfs filesystem usage works with mixed blockgroups

  Other:
    * installation to /usr/local -- this has unintentionally changed during
      conversion to autotools in 3.19

      superblock

    * if nodesize was 64k, any metadata block was reported as crossing,
      this leads to mkfs failure for example due to "no free blocks

      aligned, it was incorrectly reported by fsck
