I've identified some problems in the btrfs code and attached a btrfs-image
which causes the userland tools to crash and the kernel to immediately freeze
once the filesystem gets mounted and one of the files is accessed. Putting
the image onto a usb-drive gives you a freeze-on-a-stick :-)

"btrfs check" crashes due to a SIGFPE in count_csum_range(). The culprit is
struct btrfs_root->fs_info->super_copy->csum_size being 0, which goes
unchecked before entering a division.  I was not able to identify where the
kernel crashes (system goes down the tubes), yet the problem is probably the
same.

"btrfs version" is v3.19.1; bug is also present in latest git (kdave and
unstable) as of 2015/04/21
